		<h2>Where did Ocean Mapping get it's roots?</h2>
	<p>
		Ocean mapping is a concept for which has been in practise for hundreds of years, with those who professionally determine features regarding the
		nature of the sea bed and its characteristics as hydrogrpahic surveyors. Ocean Mapping began with the simple process of dropping a lead weight into
		the ocean with it attached to a rope. Depth would eventually be commonly measured in fathoms. In modern times, the application of the sextant 
		allowed for the precise determination of position when acquiring depth measuremnts or "soundings". Into the 20th century, we find the invneetion of
		sonar, revolutionizing the Ocean Mapping field of work.
