        	<h2>Ocean Mapping 101 - What is Ocean Mapping all about?</h2>
            <p>
		So you're interested in Ocean Mapping? You've come to the right place!
		<br>
		<br>
		This section will introduce you the concept of Ocean Mapping, and by the end of this module you should have learned:
		<br> 
		-The history of Ocean Mapping
		<br>    
		-Why we seek to map the ocean floor
		<br>    
		-How Ocean Mapping is executed    
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>Where did Ocean Mapping get it's roots?</h2>
	<p>
		Ocean mapping is a concept for which has been in practise for hundreds of years, with those who professionally determine features regarding the
		nature of the sea bed and its characteristics being hydrogrpahic surveyors. Ocean Mapping began with the simple process of dropping a lead weight into
		the ocean with it attached to a rope. Depth would eventually be commonly measured in fathoms. In modern times, the application of the sextant 
		allowed for the precise determination of position when acquiring depth measuremnts or "soundings". Into the 20th century, we find the invention of
		sonar, revolutionizing the Ocean Mapping field of work.
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>
		<h2>Why map the ocean?</h2>
	<p>
		Ocean mapping allows for surveyors to gather depth readings on the ocean floor, and with the development of sonar usage it is now possible to create a near perfect
		image or representation of what the seas floor looks like. Using these "images" of the sea floor highly detailed nautical charts may be createed for use in piloting 
		vessels, they may be used for industrial purposes such as underwaters pipelines and cables, or used by other scientists in the hydrography field for purposes such as environmental research.
		Having knowledge of the characteristics of the ocean floor is vital to almost any given  line of work or reserach involving the ocean.
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>How do we map the ocean?</h2>
		Ocean Mapping is conducted through a variety of methods to discover characteristics of the ocean floor. The most common method, of which is the method used in the Open Sonar System, is through
		the application of soanr. Sonar is the use of sound to determine the length of time it takes for a "ping" to hit the target and then return to its origin. In the case
		of ocean mapping a ping is sent from the sonar found under the vessel where it travels to the ocean floor, and then reflects back and is recieved by the sonar. The time it takes for this ping to travel 
		back to the sonar can be used to determine hwo far it travelled, or in other words how deep the ocean is at that particular point. Sonar comes in the form of single beam, where one ping is sent and recieved, or multi-beam where a multitude of pings area sent 
		and recieved at once, therfore perfomring large swaths of ocean floor coverage. Other methods of ocean mapping include laser-scanning from vessels, or LiDAR where lasers are used from planes to map shallow areas of water.
